# Belly_Button_Bacteria_Dashboard

This repository created a webpage that displays charts and graphics on patients' BellyButton Diversity. The data includes various patients ID's with their associated bacterial makeup of their BellyButton as well as other information such as demographic info and washing frequency. The webpage allows you to select a patient from the dropdown menu, which filters the data and loads unique charts for each patient. Below is a screenshot showing what the page looks like.
